It is assumed the reader is familiar with bencoding, as described in
the BitTorrent protocol specification at
http://www.bittorrent.org/protocol.html

Dictionary keys used below will be enclosed in quotation marks, these
are used for clarity and are not part of the actual key.

The IPC protocol is used to allow processes to control or retrieve
information from a Transmission frontend, such as transmission-daemon
or transmission-gtk. This communication is done over a unix-domain
socket file, such as ~/.transmission/daemon/socket. In this document
the Transmission frontend will be referred to as the server and the
process connecting to it as the client.

Once a client connects to the server's socket, messages may be
exchanged until either end closes the connection. Messages contain an
32-bit payload length, encoded as 8 bytes of ASCII hexidecimal,
followed by the payload. Upper, lower, or mixed case for the length
are all accpetable and must be handled correctly. Payload lengths
greater than 2^31 - 8 (ie: 2147483640) are not allowed.

For version 1, the message payload is a bencoded dictionary, the
valid keys and value formats for which are described below. Multiple
keys may be used in one message.

An example version 1 message:

0000000Ed4:porti9090ee

For version 2 the message payload is a bencoded list containing a
message id string followed by a bencoded value, the format of which is
the same for version 1. The value may be followed by an optional
bencoded integer, this is a message tag and is described in more
detail below.

An example version 2 message:

0000001El12:get-info-alll4:hashee

The same message with a tag:

00000021l12:get-info-alll4:hashei5ee

Once the connection is made both the client and server must send a
version 1 style message (ie: the payload is a dictionary and may not
contain a tag) with the dictionary key "version" and a value formatted
as described below. The version should be the first but not
necessarily only key in the dictionary. Any other keys should be
ignored and not processed as messages. Neither the client nor the
server should wait to receive a version message before sending one, it
must be sent immediately. No other messages should be sent until the
version is received.

The version value should be a bencoded dictionary containing two keys,
"max" and "min". These are the minimum and maximum supported protocol
versions, respectively. Communication will take place using the
highest protocol version supported by both the client and the server,
and is not possible at all if there is no common version. A client may
receive a version value that is an integer instead of a dictionary
with "min" and "max" keys. This deprecated version format indicates
the only version supported by the server.

An example message containing minimum and maximum versions 1 and 2:

0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi2eee

Tagged messages, only supported in version 2, allow a client to tag a
message with a positive non-zero integer. The server is then required
to send a response to the message even if none would normally be
required, and to tag the response with the same integer. When the
server receives a tagged message it must send exactly one message back
with the same tag. The client is allowed to use the same tag for
multiple messages, even if a response to the first is not received
before the second it sent. If a tagged message does not normally
require a response then a "succeeded", "failed" or "not-supported"
message will be sent back.

An example tagged message and response:

00000010l5:startli8eei15ee
00000011l8:succeeded0:i15ee

Some example sessions, including version handshake, are found at the
end of this file.

Dictionary keys are encoded in UTF-8 and case sensitive. Any character
except a NUL (0x00) is valid. A server or client need not support
every possible key and should silently ignore any that it does not
understand.

If a reference to a boolean is seen, it should be taken to mean an
integer with a value of 0 representing false, 1 representing true, and
any other value undefined.

Individual torrents are identified by a unique integer. This integer
is only valid for the current connection and may be invalid or refer
to another torrent in a future connection. If a torrent is closed it's
ID will never be reused to refer to another torrent for at least the
duration of the connection. Negative integers or 0 are not valid IDs.

A list of keys and the format of their values follows. Also listed is
the minimum protocol version that the key may be used with.

Example: 8:addfilesl21:/torrents/foo.torrent20:/home/me/bar.torrente
Details: Each string is the absolute path to a torrent metainfo file
         for the server to add. Note that whether or not the torrent
         metainfo file is copied (allowing the original to be moved or
         deleted safely) is implementation dependent and may not
         currently be known or changed with this protocol.

Key:     "addfile-detailed"
Version: 2
Format:  dict
Example: 16:addfile-detailedde
Details: Dictionary containing information about a torrent for the
         server to add. Valid keys include:

           "directory"  string, directory for data files for the torrent
           "autostart"  boolean, start the torrent automatically
         Either "file" or "data" is required, but both are not allowed.

Key:     "automap"
Version: 2
Format:  boolean
Example: 7:automapi1e
Details: Enable (1) or disable (0) automatic port mapping on the
         server. Other integer values will likely be treated as 1 but
         this shold not be relied upon.

Key:     "autostart"
Version: 2
Format:  boolean

         info on all the torrent IDs in "id". The "type" key requests

Examples:

Data from the client to the server is prefixed with >>> and from
server to client with <<<. These prefixes and newlines are added for
clarity, they are not actually sent over the socket.

Quit the server. Note that this is a version 1 client and so version 1
messages are used. The value for the quit message here is i0e instead
of 0: as used above, however since it it unused any value is allowed.
>>> 0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi1eee
<<< 0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi2eee
>>> 0000000Bd4:quiti0ee

>>> 0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi2eee
>>> 0000000El8:stop-all0:e
