				<h1>Portforwarding a Router</h1>

			<p>In this case, it is probably OK to disable the OS X firewall, as you are already being protected by the router. To disable the firewall, open System Prefs >> Sharing >> Firewall. Click Stop.

			<div summary="To do this" id="taskbox">
				<ol>
					<li>Find out what your IP address is. You can find your computer's IP address (on Mac OS X) by going to System Prefs >> Network, double-clicking on your connection (for instance, Built-in Ethernet), and clicking the TCP/IP tab. It's probably something like 192.168.1.100, or 10.0.1.2.</li>
					<li>Open Transmission, go to preferences, and enter a number for the port. Numbers above 45000 are recommended. Let's use 50001 for now. Then quit Transmission.</li>
					<li>Go into your router configuration screen. Normally this is done via your web browser using the address <a href="http://192.168.0.1">192.168.0.1</a> etc. Apple's Airport uses an application called 'Airport Admin Utility' to configure it.</li>
					<li>Find the port forwarding (sometimes called port mapping) screen. While the page will be different for each router generally you will enter something similar to the following:</li>

						<ul>
							<li>For 'Application' type 'Trans'. </li>
							<li>For 'Start Port' and 'End port' type 50001. </li>
							<li>For Protocol, choose Both. </li>
							<li>For IP address, type in your IP address you found in Step 1. </li>
							<li>Check Enable. </li>
							<li>Click save settings. </li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
